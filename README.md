# ParticleRain

A Minecraft mod which replaces the default rain/snow with particles.
Additionally, it also adds sand storms in desert and mesa biomes.

This is a (mostly) faithful Forge port of the [Particle Rain](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/particle-rain) mod for Fabric.

**NOTICE**: Since this mod spawns particles, it is likely to have a fairly significant impact on performance, especially on lower-end PCs.
